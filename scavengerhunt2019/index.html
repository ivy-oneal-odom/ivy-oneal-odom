		<p>Hello Oliver! This is the homepage of your 20th birthday party! I started working on this project a little while ago, so some of the references may be outdated/hard to remember. Feel free to ask me for hints! Also, don't worry. This will still involve running around campus. I'm just a lazy mother fucker who wanted to write the whole project from the comfort of home. ❤️</p>

		<p><b>How to Play:</b> Each webpage will have a clue/riddle/puzzle etc. Once you figure out the answer, put it (all lower case) in the url after "scavengerhunt2019/". This first clue will be super easy, just to make sure that the mechanics of play are well understood. (Also, there is at least one way that you could just view all the documents on this website, ruining the scavenger hunt. Please don't do that and please don't google any of the answers to the clues).</p>

		<p><b>Clue #1:</b> What is my name?</p>
